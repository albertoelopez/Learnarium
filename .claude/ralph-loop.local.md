prompt: Build Vizloci MVP Phase 1: A memory palace learning app. Requirements: 1) Palace template JSON schema (already started in src/types/palace-template.ts) with rooms and objects. 2) LangChain chain that takes user description and generates palace template JSON. 3) Next.js web app with palace editor UI where users can view/edit generated palace or create from scratch. 4) LangChain chain that takes learning text + palace template and maps concepts to objects with mnemonic hints. 5) 3D visualization using react-three-fiber that renders the palace with mapped concepts. Tech stack: Next.js, TypeScript, LangChain, react-three-fiber + drei. CRITICAL: Follow TDD - write tests before implementation using Jest + React Testing Library. All features must have unit tests and basic E2E tests with Playwright. Make the app actually work end-to-end.
completion_promise: User can describe their space via prompt, the AI generates a palace template, user can paste learning text, AI maps concepts to objects in the palace, and user sees their palace in 3D with concepts placed on objects

# Ralph Wiggum Loop - Iteration 1 of 20

## Your Task
Build Vizloci MVP Phase 1: A memory palace learning app. Requirements: 1) Palace template JSON schema (already started in src/types/palace-template.ts) with rooms and objects. 2) LangChain chain that takes user description and generates palace template JSON. 3) Next.js web app with palace editor UI where users can view/edit generated palace or create from scratch. 4) LangChain chain that takes learning text + palace template and maps concepts to objects with mnemonic hints. 5) 3D visualization using react-three-fiber that renders the palace with mapped concepts. Tech stack: Next.js, TypeScript, LangChain, react-three-fiber + drei. CRITICAL: Follow TDD - write tests before implementation using Jest + React Testing Library. All features must have unit tests and basic E2E tests with Playwright. Make the app actually work end-to-end.

## Completion Promise
User can describe their space via prompt, the AI generates a palace template, user can paste learning text, AI maps concepts to objects in the palace, and user sees their palace in 3D with concepts placed on objects

## Rules
1. Work on the task above
2. Check your progress in files and git history
3. If the completion promise is TRUE, output it exactly to exit
4. If iteration 1 >= 20, the loop will end
5. Otherwise, continue iterating to improve your work

## Status
- Current iteration: 1
